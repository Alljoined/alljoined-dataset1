Here we are trying to preprocess Alljoined1 in a similar method to EEG2

Reference based off of https://github.com/Alljoined/EEG_Image_decode/blob/orig_code_alljoined_ds/EEG-preprocessing/preprocessing.py


### Files

**plot_raw_matplotlib.ipynb**: takes the epoch data before preprocessing and plots it with matplotlib

**plot_preprocessed.ipynb**: reads the saved preprocessed np data and plots it with matplotlib
